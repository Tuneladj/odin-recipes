    <h1>Fisherman Soup</h1>
    <img src="fisherman_soup.jpeg" alt="Freshly Served Fisherman Soup">
    <p>Nigerian Fisherman soup is a simple soup made with fish and other seafood as its protein source. It is called Efere Ndek Iyak in Efik and is indigenous to the people of Akwa-Ibom and Cross River states of Nigeria. Living with rivers winding through their towns and villages and bound by the Atlantic ocean, they have an abundance of seafood.</p>
    <p>Fisherman soup is quite easy to prepare. The fish used here is a mature catfish, I also included a small lobster. The thickener of choice is yam, but you can use cocoyam or any other thickener but nothing with an overbearing taste. There will be some subtle difference in taste with each type of thickener.</p>
    <p>The fish is normally fresh from the river but any fish will do. Use as much pepper as you can tolerate, Nigerian seafood soups and stews usually have some heat (pepper) in them. Okro is optional, in fact, some people don’t want any type of sliminess in their Fisherman soup, my Rennaisance man will not eat it once there is okro in it.</p>
